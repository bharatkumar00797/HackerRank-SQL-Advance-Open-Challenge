You are given a database schema with two tables: Employees and Performance. 
The Employees table stores information about employees, including their employee_id, name, and department_id.
The Performance table stores information about the performance ratings of employees, including their employee_id, year, and rating.

Write a SQL query to find the top-performing employee in each department for the year 2023.
If there are ties (i.e., multiple employees in the same department with the same highest rating), return all of them.

The output should include the department_id, employee_id, name, and rating of the top-performing employee(s) in each department.
